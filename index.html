<h1>LIKE NATURE<br>GO GREEN...!!</h1>
<p>Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of the human activities.<br> The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system.<br> Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts from nature.<br> Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature. Escaping away in the nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul.<br> Irrespective of what nature provides us it is also our moral and social responsibility to nurture nature.</p>
